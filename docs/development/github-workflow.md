## Development Workflow Rules for OpenBadges

### 1. Feature Development Flow

```bash
# 1. Create feature branch from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/badge-verification-api

# 2. Link to GitHub issue with OpenBadges context
git commit -m "feat(verification): implement cryptographic badge validation

Implements RSA signature verification for OpenBadges 2.x badges.
Includes comprehensive error handling and security validation.

- Add signature verification using RSA-SHA256
- Implement proof validation for OpenBadges 3.0
- Add input sanitization for badge data
- Include comprehensive test coverage

Closes #123
OpenBadges-Version: 2.x, 3.0
Security-Review: Required"

# 3. Push and create PR with compliance checklist
git push origin feature/badge-verification-api
gh pr create --title "feat(verification): OpenBadges Cryptographic Validation"
```

### 2. OpenBadges Automated Checks

- **Pre-commit hooks**: Lint, format, type-check, security scan
- **PR validation**: OpenBadges compliance, security validation, tests
- **Compliance validation**: Ensure PR follows OpenBadges specifications
- **Security scanning**: Cryptographic operation validation

This workflow creates a comprehensive integration between our internal task management and GitHub's project management features, specifically tailored for secure OpenBadges digital credential development.
