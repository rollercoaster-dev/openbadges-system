    TASKS[Internal Tasks] <--> ISSUES[GitHub Issues]
    ISSUES --> PRS[Pull Requests]
    PRS --> COMPLIANCE[OpenBadges Compliance Check]
    COMPLIANCE --> SECURITY[Security Scan]
    SECURITY --> ACTIONS[GitHub Actions]
    ACTIONS --> TASKS
```

### 2. OpenBadges Component Structure

The system includes specialized components for digital credential management:

- **Authentication**: OAuth, JWT, user authentication systems

- **API**: REST endpoints, OpenBadges-compliant API design
- **Frontend**: Vue components, UI/UX for credential interfaces
- **Compliance**: OpenBadges 2.x/3.0 specification adherence
- **Security**: Cryptography, data protection, key management

### 3. GitHub Templates for OpenBadges

Three specialized issue templates are available:
- **Feature Request** (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature.yml`) - OpenBadges feature development
- **Bug Report** (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug.yml`) - Credential/badge-related bugs
- **Task Implementation** (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/task.yml`) - Implementation tasks with compliance tracking

## 📋 OpenBadges Development Workflow

### Step 1: Task Creation and Planning

1. **Create Internal Tasks** using our task management system
2. **Define OpenBadges Context** - specify which OpenBadges version (2.x/3.0)
3. **Identify Compliance Requirements** - mark security and compliance needs
4. **Assign Components** (Authentication, Badge Management, Verification, etc.)

### Step 2: GitHub Issue Creation

**Option A: Automatic Creation**
```bash
# Use the task sync workflow
gh workflow run task-sync.yml \
  --field action=create-issues-from-tasks \
  --field milestone="OpenBadges Sprint 1" \
  --field dry-run=false
```

**Option B: Manual Creation**
1. Go to GitHub Issues → New Issue
2. Select appropriate template (Feature/Bug/Task)
3. Fill in OpenBadges-specific fields:
   - Component (Authentication, Badge Management, etc.)
   - OpenBadges Version (2.x, 3.0, Both)
   - Compliance Considerations checkboxes
4. Include Task ID if linking to existing task

### Step 3: Development Process

1. **Create Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/123-badge-verification-api
   ```

2. **Follow OpenBadges Naming Convention**
   - `feature/123-badge-management` - Links to issue #123
   - `bugfix/456-verification-fix` - Links to issue #456
   - `compliance/789-openbadges-3-support` - Compliance-related work

3. **Make Commits with OpenBadges Context**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat(verification): implement cryptographic badge validation
   
   - Add RSA signature verification for OpenBadges 2.x
   - Implement proof validation for OpenBadges 3.0
   - Add comprehensive error handling for invalid badges
   
   Closes #123
   Task: badge-verification-001"
   ```

### Step 4: Pull Request Creation

1. **Push Branch and Create PR**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/123-badge-verification-api
   gh pr create --title "feat(verification): OpenBadges Cryptographic Validation"
   ```

2. **Fill Out OpenBadges PR Template**
   - Link to related issues: `Closes #123`
   - Include Task ID: `Task ID: badge-verification-001`
   - Complete OpenBadges compliance checklist
   - Mark security review requirements
   - Add component areas affected

3. **Automated OpenBadges Validation**
   - PR title format validation
   - OpenBadges compliance checking
   - Security scanning for credential handling
   - Cryptographic operation validation
   - Template completion verification

### Step 5: Code Review and Merge

1. **OpenBadges Review Process**
   - Automated compliance checks must pass
   - Security scan must pass
   - At least one approval required
   - OpenBadges specification adherence verified

2. **Merge Process**
   - Squash and merge preferred
   - Automated issue closure
   - Task status updates
   - Compliance validation triggers
