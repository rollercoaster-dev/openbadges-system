```

### 2. Task Status Flow

```mermaid
graph LR
    NOT_STARTED --> IN_PROGRESS
    IN_PROGRESS --> REVIEW
    REVIEW --> SECURITY_REVIEW
    SECURITY_REVIEW --> COMPLIANCE_CHECK
    COMPLIANCE_CHECK --> TESTING
    TESTING --> COMPLETE
    
    REVIEW --> IN_PROGRESS
    SECURITY_REVIEW --> IN_PROGRESS
    COMPLIANCE_CHECK --> IN_PROGRESS
    TESTING --> IN_PROGRESS
```

### 3. Status Definitions

- **NOT_STARTED**: Task created but work not begun
- **IN_PROGRESS**: Active development in progress
- **REVIEW**: Code review and peer validation
- **SECURITY_REVIEW**: Cryptographic and security validation
- **COMPLIANCE_CHECK**: OpenBadges specification compliance validation
- **TESTING**: Integration and compliance testing
- **COMPLETE**: All requirements met and deployed

## üîó GitHub Integration

### Automatic Issue Creation

Tasks can automatically create GitHub issues:

```bash
# Create issues from tasks
gh workflow run task-sync.yml \
  --field action=create-issues-from-tasks \
  --field milestone="OpenBadges Sprint 1" \
  --field dry-run=false
```

### Task-Issue Linking

Issues are automatically linked to tasks through:
- **Task ID in issue body**: Extracted and tracked
- **Component labels**: Auto-assigned based on task component
- **Priority labels**: Synced with task priority
- **Compliance labels**: Added for OpenBadges-related tasks

### Status Synchronization

Task status automatically updates based on:
- **Issue assignment**: Task moves to IN_PROGRESS
- **PR creation**: Task status reflects development progress
- **PR merge**: Task moves to COMPLETE
- **Issue closure**: Task marked as COMPLETE

## üìä Task Metrics and Reporting

### Development Velocity
- **Tasks completed per sprint**
- **Average task completion time**
- **Component-specific velocity**
- **Compliance task resolution rate**

### Quality Metrics
- **Security review pass rate**
- **Compliance validation success rate**
- **Bug rate per component**
- **Test coverage per task**

### OpenBadges-Specific Metrics
- **Specification compliance rate**
- **Security vulnerability resolution time**
- **Cryptographic operation test coverage**
- **Badge verification accuracy**

## üõ†Ô∏è Task Management Operations

### Creating Tasks

```javascript
// Example task creation
const task = {
  id: generateUUID(),
  title: "Implement OAuth 2.0 Badge Provider Integration",
  component: "Authentication",
  priority: "High",
  openBadgesVersion: ["2.x", "3.0"],
  estimate: "1 week",
  description: "Integrate OAuth 2.0 for badge provider authentication...",
  acceptanceCriteria: [
    "OAuth 2.0 flow implemented",
    "Provider registration system",
    "Token management and refresh",
    "Security audit completed"
  ],
  securityRequirements: [
    "PKCE implementation",
    "State parameter validation",
    "Token encryption",
    "Audit logging"
  ],
  complianceRequirements: [
    "OpenBadges Connect API compatibility",
    "Standard OAuth 2.0 compliance",
    "Privacy policy adherence"
  ]
};
```

### Updating Task Status

```bash
# Manual status update
gh workflow run task-sync.yml \
  --field action=sync-task-status \
  --field dry-run=false
```

### Exporting to GitHub Projects

```bash
# Export task hierarchy to GitHub Projects
gh workflow run task-sync.yml \
  --field action=export-tasks-to-project \
  --field dry-run=false
```

## üîç Task Monitoring

### Dashboard Views
- **Sprint Board**: Current sprint tasks by status
- **Component View**: Tasks organized by OpenBadges component
- **Priority Matrix**: Tasks by priority and urgency
- **Compliance Tracker**: OpenBadges specification compliance status

### Automated Alerts
- **Overdue Tasks**: Tasks past estimated completion
- **Security Reviews**: Tasks requiring security validation
- **Compliance Issues**: Tasks with specification compliance problems
- **Blocked Tasks**: Tasks waiting on dependencies

## üìà Best Practices

### Task Creation
1. **Clear Titles**: Use descriptive, component-specific titles
2. **Detailed Descriptions**: Include OpenBadges context and requirements

2. **Dependency Tracking**: Identify and manage task dependencies
3. **Component Ownership**: Assign component experts to relevant tasks
4. **Security Reviews**: Schedule security reviews for cryptographic tasks
5. **Compliance Validation**: Validate OpenBadges specification adherence

### Integration Usage
1. **Link Everything**: Connect tasks to issues and PRs
2. **Use Automation**: Leverage automated status updates
3. **Monitor Metrics**: Track velocity and quality metrics
4. **Review Regularly**: Conduct regular task and process reviews

This task management system ensures efficient coordination of OpenBadges development while maintaining high standards for security, compliance, and quality.
